1) no edge constraints, all edges unique [10 points]
2) N=8 M=20 naive brute force [10 points]
3) N=1000 M=1000 [10 pts]
4) N=1000 M=1001 [10 points]
5) Only type 1 constraints, line with intervals
6) 1 spanning tree with a bunch of bullshit edges (weight + 100000)
7) 20 spanning trees
8) 99 spanning trees and few rogue components
9) 1 spanning tree with a bunch of non-bullshit edges with weight + 10000
10) Test case 1 except constraints dont affect the answer, multiply by 3

Solutions:

1. MST naive
2. MST no edge left behind
3. Brute force (M choose N-1)
4. DP on intervals

Solutions to test:

- Beamsearch
- SA
- Random edge garbage (take an edge, figure out which edges it connects to, greedy)
- Actual greedy
